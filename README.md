# scorekeeper

scorekeeper app as teached by Angela Yu
in the Flutter course on Udemy. 

This app is published for other students to learn from what I do.
Just as I learned a lot from studying the work of other students. 

This repo is not going to be published as an app  in any of the app stores. 

As far as my ownership of this project goes it is published under the MIT license.
